            <h2>About Project</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                For the final project, my group decided to explore COVID-19 vaccination rates across US counties,
                allowing users to understand geographic disparities in vaccine uptake through an explorable map
                interface. By combining county-level CDC vaccination data with interactive D3.js visualizations,
                the project enables both broad national trends and granular local analysis. As of now our D3
                visualization is not complete, however, at completion it will depict a map of the United States with
                counties colored based on their vaccination rates, and we are currently exploring the idea of including
                other statistics such as education levels and GDP contribution alongside vaccination rate, however, this
                is just a consideration for the time being.
